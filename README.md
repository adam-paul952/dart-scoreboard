## Dart Scoreboard

---

### **Description**

Dart Scoreboard is a dart scoring web app which allows users to enter player names and calculate scoring for the different games.

---

### **Motivation**

My friends and I play quite a bit of darts. I decided to make this app to include more of the games we play outside of the standard X01 and Cricket which is found on most dart apps.

#### **Games**

- **Baseball** :white_check_mark:
- **X01** :white_check_mark:
- **Cricket** :white_check_mark:
- **Elimination** :white_check_mark:
- **Killer**
