## Dart Scoreboard

---

### **Description**

Dart Scoreboard is a dart scoring web app which allows users to enter player names and calculate scoring for the different games.

This app can be used as it is, but once the browser is closed players will have to be added the next time you play.

But with this REST API backend [dart-scoreboard-server](https://github.com/adam-paul952/dart-scoreboard-server) it allows users to create a profile to store the players in a database. Check it out!

### **Motivation**

My friends and I play quite a bit of darts. I decided to make this app to include more of the games we play outside of the standard X01 and Cricket which is found on most dart apps.
